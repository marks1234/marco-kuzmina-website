My background includes five years of study in the UK, where I developed analytical problem-solving skills, a strong sense of responsibility, and gained practical experience working in cross-cultural teams. \n\nI have experience in both back-end and front-end development, and I have also worked on side projects involving website and app creation. Across all my projects, my focus has been on creating solutions that are both functional and easy to use. \n\nI thrive in groups that value open communication, approach problem-solving enthusiastically, and maintain a balance between independent and team work."
